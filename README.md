# Satelite Image Segmentation

Segmentation using deep learning is a popular approach to tackle the problem of Deep Semantic Segmentation. The goal is to get a mask composed of 6 categories from a satelite image taken as input, to do so each pixel of the given image must be classified into one of the categories.

# Dataset üõ∞Ô∏è
From Dubai's Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center.

The dataset consists of aerial imagery of Dubai obtained by MBRSC satellites and annotated with pixel-wise semantic segmentation in 6 classes.
